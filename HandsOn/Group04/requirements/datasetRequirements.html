Which will be the license to be used for the generated dataset?

 

In this Assessment we will work with two Datasests that will be linked after.

The license for the generated dataset will be the same of the original datasets, seeing that the two datasets are owned and published by Leeds City Council.

the potontiel dataset will hold the must of the clauses of the original licence under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 and the Open Data Commons Attribution License that garnties the right to :

-        copy, publish, distribute and transmit the Information;

-        adapt the Information;

-        exploit the Information commercially and non-commercially ,eather by combining it with other Information, or by including it with thier  products or applications.

 

ü  Entities That can be linked with other Datasets:

 

- The first Dataset is about Road Traffic Accident in Leeds City and it includes several information such as the Easting and Northing of the location where the accident occurred.

- The second Dataset is about Traffic Signals in Leeds and it provides details of all traffic signals in Leeds including their address and Easting/Northing coordinates.

      

       = > We can use Easting and Northing coordinates in the first dataset and link it with the second Dataset to know the location name and if a traffic signal installation exist on that address.

 

ü  Verifying Requirements Satisfaction:

 

R1. Data are in the smart cities domain.

      Road Traffic Accident Analysis in Leeds City.

R2. Data are available as a CSV file.

      Datasets were available in CSV format :  Leeds_RTC_2017.csv  & Traffic Signals.csv 

R3. Data have an open license so it can be published.

     Both Datasets are owned and published by Leeds City Council.

R4. Data can be easily linked with generic real-world entities (e.g., locations).

     The first dataset (Road Traffic Accident) could be linked with other Datasets such as Traffic Signals (in our case).

     But if we want to go further, we can link it also with more Datasets such as Radars and Sensors locations across Leeds City to have more detailed analysis about Accidents.
