Application Requirement 

 

The suggested application is a Road Traffic Analysis App, it will uses the information provided in different Datasets such as Road Traffic Accident Dataset and Traffic Signal Dataset to display the exact location of the accident on a map.

 
The Application will serve several purposes:

§  Produce graphical Results (Charts, Graphs…) about the most likely reasons of the accident based on (weather condition, road condition, Lightening, Time..).

§  Display where the accident occurred on a map for the entities who are not familiar with database information.

§  Other purposes depending on the other Datasets that can be linked to these two.

We will be using two Datasets , the first one will provide details about the accident, the second one will redirect us toward the exact address of the accident and the display it on a map.
